# Harshitha's-Project-Portfolio
[Project 1: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/harshithakumar-viji/App-profile)


In this project I learnt complete data science workflow:

* Clarified the goal of the project
* Collected relevant data
* Cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis
* Analyzed the cleaned data

[Project 2: Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/harshithakumar-viji/Hacker_posts)

In this project, I learnt how to work with strings, Object-oriented programming, dates and time
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit.
Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
 * Analyzed if Ask or Show posts receive more comments
 * Analyzed if posts created at certain time receive more comments on average
 * Evaluated the number of ask posts and comments by hour created
 * Calculated the average number of comments for ask posts by hour
 * Extracted the top 5 hours for ask posts comments

[Project 3: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-96](https://github.com/harshithakumar-viji/Traffic-indicator)

The objective of this project was to determine the factors affecting traffic. The focus is on exploratory data visualization using Pandas and matplotlib.
Learnt the following:
* How to visualize time series data with plots
* How to visualize correlations with scatter plots
* How to visualize frequency distributions with bar plots and histigrams
* How to speed up visalization workflow with the help of Pandas library
   
[Paper Publication: Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms](https://doi.org/10.21276/ijirem.2021.8.4.2)

This paper was published as a research project to fulfill the bachelor's degree requirement.
Stroke is a destructive illness that typically influences individuals over the age of 65 years age. Prediction of stroke is a time consuming and tedious for doctors. Therefore, the project mainly aims at predicting the chances of occurrence of stroke using the emerging Machine Learning techniques. Five different algorithms are used and a comparison is made for better accuracy. Aim is to create an application with a user-friendly interface which is easy to navigate and enter inputs.
